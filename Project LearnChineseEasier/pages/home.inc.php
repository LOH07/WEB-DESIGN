	The purpose of this website is to help those who want to learn Mandarin Chinese.
	<br/><br/> <span class="span1">What does this website offer?</span><br/><br/>
	This website helps you to evaluate your knowledge of Chinese words and Chinese characters (Hanzi 汉字).
	In this way you will know what to focus on as you learn the Chinese language.
	<br/><br/><span class="span1">How does it work?</span><br/><br/>
	There are 2 kinds of tests: <span class="span2">Vocabulary Tests</span> and <span class="span2">Hanzi Tests</span>.
	<br/><br/><span class="span2">Vocabulary Tests</span> help you evaluate your knowledge of Chinese words.
	<span class="span2">Hanzi Tests</span> help you evaluate your knowledge of Chinese characters (radicals).
	Every time you take the tests, it will help you memorize the words and characters you have studied.
	In this way you will learn Chinese easier and faster.
	<br/>All tests are based on <a id="cme" href="http://www.chinesemadeeasier.com" target="_blank">Chinese Made Easier</a> by Martin Symonds. 
	I also used this book when I was a student in China and it proved to be a good book.
	<br/>When you are ready to start, click on the menu above and choose one of the tests.
